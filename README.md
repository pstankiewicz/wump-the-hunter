Basic Tenliners 2017 Competition Entry

Tagline
=======

You are Mythical Wumpus. You live (mostly sleeping) happy and peaceful life in your [dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedron).

But the Hunters are killing you! Literally! Can you get rid of them?

Running game
============

On real metal
-------------

Transfer d64 file to floppy, or mount it using SD2IEC/Ultimate1541 solution, and load WTH.MIN (tenliner) or WTH.FULL (commented manyliner). Then just run it.

On emulator
-----------

Please - who needs emulators? But just in case - follow your emulator manual. In vice it will be mounting d64 file and (same as on real thing) loading WTH.FULL or WTH.MIN file, and running it.

Playing the game
================

You are put in random dodecahedron place. You are sleeping. If any hunter steps in same room as you, you will autmatically kill him. If any hunter gets in any room near your current position, you feel something is wrong, and you must choose a room to check. If you success, you kill hunter. If you fail, hunter catches and kills you.

In the end you will die. This is sad Wumpus life - countles of players just trying to kill poor Wumpus. Poor You. Question is - how many Hunters will you kill before your end?
